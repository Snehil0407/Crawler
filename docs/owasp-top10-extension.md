## A05: Security Misconfiguration

The scanner checks for security misconfigurations including missing security headers, open directory listing, and verbose error messages.

### What it checks:

- Missing security headers:
  - Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - Strict-Transport-Security
- Open directory listing (status 200 with `<title>Index of`)
- Verbose error messages or stack traces
- Default configuration files or credentials

### Configuration:

```python
config.set('scan_security_misconfigurations', True)  # Enable/disable security misconfiguration scanning
```

### Implementation:

The scanner uses the `security_misconfiguration.py` module to:

1. Check HTTP response headers for missing security headers
2. Examine page content for directory listing indicators
3. Look for verbose error messages and stack traces
4. Check for default configuration files

## Integration into Scanner

The OWASP Top 10 scanner modules are integrated into the main scanner pipeline in `scanner.py`:

1. Each module is imported from its respective file
2. Configuration options are set in the scanner constructor
3. Each vulnerability check is run during the URL scanning process
4. Results are saved in the same format as other vulnerabilities
5. Both local storage and Firebase storage options are supported

## Complete Usage Example

To run a scan with all OWASP Top 10 checks enabled:

```python
from scanner.config import ScannerConfig
from scanner.scanner import Scanner

config = ScannerConfig()

config.set('scan_insecure_design', True)            # A04: Insecure Design
config.set('scan_security_misconfigurations', True) # A05: Security Misconfiguration
config.set('scan_vulnerable_components', True)      # A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components
config.set('scan_auth_failures', True)              # A07: Identification and Authentication Failures
config.set('scan_integrity_failures', True)         # A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures
config.set('scan_logging_monitoring', True)         # A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
config.set('scan_ssrf', True)                       # A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

# Create scanner with configuration
scanner = Scanner(config)

# Start scan
scan_id = scanner.start_scan("https://example.com")

# Get results
results = scanner.get_results()
print(f"Found {len(results['vulnerabilities'])} vulnerabilities")

# Analyze results by vulnerability type
vuln_types = {}
for vuln in results['vulnerabilities']:
    vuln_type = vuln['type']
    if vuln_type not in vuln_types:
        vuln_types[vuln_type] = 0
    vuln_types[vuln_type] += 1

print("\nVulnerabilities by type:")
for vuln_type, count in vuln_types.items():
    print(f"- {vuln_type}: {count}")
```

# Conversation Storage Testing Guide

This guide helps you test the enhanced conversation storage functionality to ensure everything works correctly.

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Conversation Creation and Retrieval
1. **Start a new chat**
   - Select a security scan from the dropdown
   - Send a message: "What are the critical vulnerabilities found?"
   - Verify: New session appears in chat history with smart title

2. **Load previous conversation**
   - Close the current chat (start new chat or refresh page)
   - Open chat history sidebar
   - Click on the previous conversation
   - Verify: All previous messages are restored and displayed

### Test 2: Multiple Conversations
1. **Create multiple chats**
   - Start 3-4 different conversations with different scans
   - Use different types of questions:
     - "Analyze SQL injection vulnerabilities"
     - "Show me XSS issues"
     - "What remediation steps do you recommend?"
     - "Generate a security report"

2. **Verify smart titles**
   - Check that titles are automatically generated:
     - "SQL Injection Analysis"
     - "XSS Analysis"  
     - "Remediation Guide"
     - "Security Report"

3. **Switch between conversations**
   - Click different conversations in history
   - Verify each loads with complete message history
   - Verify no message mixing between conversations

### Test 3: User-Specific Storage
1. **Test with authentication**
   - Login as User A
   - Create some conversations
   - Note conversation count in debug panel

2. **Switch users**
   - Logout and login as User B
   - Verify: User B sees empty conversation history
   - Create conversations as User B

3. **Switch back**
   - Logout and login as User A
   - Verify: User A's original conversations are still there
   - Verify: User B's conversations are not visible

### Test 4: Debug Panel Features
1. **Access debug panel**
   - Open chat history sidebar
   - Click settings (gear) icon
   - Verify debug panel opens with statistics

2. **Test export functionality**
   - Click "Export" button
   - Verify: JSON file downloads with conversation data
   - Open file and verify structure is correct

3. **Test import functionality**
   - Delete all conversations (or create new user)
   - Click "Import" button
   - Select the previously exported JSON file
   - Verify: All conversations are restored correctly

4. **Test search functionality**
   - Type search terms in the search box
   - Verify: Conversations are filtered correctly
   - Test searching by title, URL, and message content

### Test 5: Storage Persistence
1. **Browser refresh test**
   - Create several conversations
   - Refresh the browser page
   - Verify: All conversations persist after refresh

2. **Browser restart test**
   - Create conversations
   - Close browser completely
   - Reopen browser and navigate to the app
   - Verify: Conversations are still there

3. **Logout/login persistence**
   - Create conversations while logged in
   - Logout and login again
   - Verify: Conversations are preserved

### Test 6: Error Handling
1. **Storage limit test** (Advanced)
   - Create many conversations (or import large dataset)
   - Monitor browser console for storage warnings
   - Verify: System handles storage limits gracefully

2. **Corrupted data test** (Advanced)
   - Using browser dev tools, corrupt localStorage data
   - Reload page
   - Verify: System handles corrupted data without crashing

## üéØ Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators
- All conversations are preserved across browser sessions
- Clicking on chat history loads complete conversation
- Smart titles are generated automatically
- User-specific storage works correctly
- Export/import functionality works
- Search functionality works
- No message duplication or loss
- No mixing of conversations between users
- Graceful error handling

### ‚ùå Failure Indicators
- Conversations disappear after refresh
- Clicking chat history shows empty or incomplete conversation
- Generic titles instead of smart titles
- Users see each other's conversations
- Export/import doesn't work
- Search doesn't find relevant conversations
- Duplicate messages appear
- App crashes or shows errors

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Conversations not loading**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify localStorage permissions
   - Try clearing browser cache and starting fresh

2. **User mixing conversations**
   - Verify user authentication is working
   - Check if user ID is properly set
   - Look for authentication context issues

3. **Storage quota issues**
   - Check browser storage usage
   - Use debug panel to see storage statistics
   - Clear old conversations if needed

4. **Export/import issues**
   - Verify file format is correct JSON
   - Check file permissions
   - Ensure browser allows file downloads/uploads

### Debug Information
Use the debug panel to get detailed information:
- Total sessions and messages
- Storage usage statistics
- Session details and metadata
- Error logs and warnings

## üìù Test Checklist
